# Lifting state

## 📝 Your Notes

Elaborate on your learnings here in `src/exercise/03.md`

The important concept of the lift state exercise is to understand if we have a
sibling component that is sharing state with its sibling. Then we need to move
the state to the lowest common parent component between the two.

In this case since our `Display` component was getting state from the `animal`
component and the `name` component. We could see that the `name` component had
its state located in the `App` so we needed to move (lift) the state to the
`App` component.

Colocating the state was a very simple process of making sure: Do we actually
need this state component in our parent to be held? If so then there is no point
of having that state out in the entire app forcing re-renders when we're not
using that state.

It might be a small performance gain to remove the state from the parent level
to its own individual localized component level but it does a lot in terms of
maintainability.

## Background

A common question from React beginners is how to share state between two sibling
components. The answer is to
["lift the state"](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html) which
basically amounts to finding the lowest common parent shared between the two
components and placing the state management there, and then passing the state
and a mechanism for updating that state down into the components that need it.

👨‍💼 Peter told us we've got a new feature request for the `Display` component. He
wants us to display the `animal` the user selects. But that state is managed in
a "sibling" component, so we have to move that management to the lowest common
parent (`App`) and then pass it down.

## Extra Credit

As a community we’re pretty good at lifting state. It becomes natural over time.
One thing that we typically have trouble remembering to do is to push state back
down (or
[colocate state](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/state-colocation-will-make-your-react-app-faster)).

👨‍💼 Peter told us that now users only want the animal displayed instead of the
name:

```javascript
function Display({animal}) {
  return <div>{`Your favorite animal is: ${animal}!`}</div>
}
```

You'll notice that just updating the `Display` component to this works fine, but
for the extra credit, go through the process of moving state to the components
that need it. You know what you just did for the `Animal` component? You need to
do the opposite thing for the `Name` component.
