# useState: greeting

## 📝 Your Notes

Elaborate on your learnings here in `src/exercise/01.md`

The exercise was a good warmup/refresher based off the fundamentals module
before but I still made a similiar mistake as the previous module where I passed
the initialName prop incorrectly by not destructuring it into an object with a
default passed.

❌`function Greeting(initialName)` -> ✔️`function Greeting({initialName=''})`

Need to really understand why this is not optimal -> my current understanding is
that if its not passed as a destructured object we can't pass or extract data.
This is soldified by when I tried to pass a value to the initialName when I
didn't pass it as a destructured object.

```javascript
function Greeting(initialName = '') {
  const [name, setName] = React.useState(initialName)

  function handleChange(event) {
    //console.dir(event)
    setName(event.target.value)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <form>
        <label htmlFor="name">Name: </label>
        <input onChange={handleChange} id="name" />
      </form>
      {name ? <strong>Hello {name}</strong> : 'Please type your name'}
    </div>
  )
}

function App() {
  return <Greeting initialName="Kevin" />
}

export default App
```

This resulted in a blank page with this error:

`Uncaught Error: Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {initialName}). If you meant to render a collection of children, use an array instead.`

## Background

Normally an interactive application will need to hold state somewhere. In React,
you use special functions called "hooks" to do this. Common built-in hooks
include:

- `React.useState`
- `React.useEffect`
- `React.useContext`
- `React.useRef`
- `React.useReducer`

Each of these is a special function that you can call inside your custom React
component function to store data (like state) or perform actions (or
side-effects). There are a few more built-in hooks that have special use cases,
but the ones above are what you'll be using most of the time.

Each of the hooks has a unique API. Some return a value (like `React.useRef` and
`React.useContext`), others return a pair of values (like `React.useState` and
`React.useReducer`), and others return nothing at all (like `React.useEffect`).

Here's an example of a component that uses the `useState` hook and an onClick
event handler to update that state:

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  const increment = () => setCount(count + 1)
  return <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>
}
```

`React.useState` is a function that accepts a single argument. That argument is
the initial state for the instance of the component. In our case, the state will
start as `0`.

`React.useState` returns a pair of values. It does this by returning an array
with two elements (and we use destructuring syntax to assign each of those
values to distinct variables). The first of the pair is the state value and the
second is a function we can call to update the state. We can name these
variables whatever we want. Common convention is to choose a name for the state
variable, then prefix `set` in front of that for the updater function.

State can be defined as: data that changes over time. So how does this work over
time? When the button is clicked, our `increment` function will be called at
which time we update the `count` by calling `setCount`.

When we call `setCount`, that tells React to re-render our component. When it
does this, the entire `Counter` function is re-run, so when `React.useState` is
called this time, the value we get back is the value that we called `setCount`
with. And it continues like that until `Counter` is unmounted (removed from the
application), or the user closes the application.

## Exercise

Production deploys:

- [Exercise](https://react-hooks.netlify.app/isolated/exercise/01.js)
- [Final](https://react-hooks.netlify.app/isolated/final/01.js)

In this exercise we have a form where you can type in your name and it will give
you a greeting as you type. Fill out the `Greeting` component so that it manages
the state of the name and shows the greeting as the name is changed.

## Extra Credit

### 1. 💯 accept an initialName

[Production deploy](https://react-hooks.netlify.app/isolated/final/01.extra-1.js)

Make the `Greeting` accept a prop called `initialName` and initialize the `name`
state to that value.
